## BLOWFISH

**A gamifying token with DApps and deflationary lotteries.** \
From its inception, **BlowFish** presented itself as a fun token, and our ongoing projects have reflected that. \
**BlowFish** aims to leverage gamification to return value to BLOWF holders.\
We achieve this in three primary ways:\
-profit distribution from DApps\
-token burns\
-oracle utility
